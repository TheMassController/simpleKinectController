This is an very simple GUI on which the user will be able to set the Kinect height and look through its camera.
Multi-Kinect will be supported
OpenGL will be used to render the images.

Created with Qt 4.8.4 and Microsoft Kinect SDK. Used compiler is the MSVC2012 x86_64 compiler (yes, I compiled my very own Qt 4.8.4 for this).

Originally started on Qt 5.0.2, but downgraded because of OpenGL issues.
